.SYNOPSIS
    A robust script to automatically stash, pull, commit, and push changes to a Git repository.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script is designed to be called by the main automator. It safely synchronizes
    the local and remote repositories by stashing local changes before pulling,
    and intelligently handles cases where there are no local changes to stash.
