Tome of the Automaton Enchanter

Found among the effects of a traveling Telvanni master, this text describes two powerful scripts of Dwemer-like artifice, designed to bring order to the chaos of a thousand-and-one alterations

The First Scroll: The Rite of Harmonious Integration (openmw-config-automator.ps1).
This master script is an automaton that orchestrates your alterations with tireless precision.
When its incantation is uttered, it performs the following rites:

Cleansing and Scrying:
It first cleanses your alteration-containers (mod folders) of improper symbols.
It then scries their contents, navigating complex structures and consulting your will when faced with multiple paths (such as FOMOD installers).

Scribing and Forging:
Your choices are scribed to memory scrolls (the mod_choices folder) for future use.
Once your will is known, it forges a master decree (momw-customizations.toml) and commands a lesser golem (momw-configurator) to enact it upon the openmw.cfg.

The Final Ordering:
As a final touch, it ensures specific incantations (like content=LuaMultiMark.omwaddon) are placed in their proper sequence within the openmw.cfg.
The Second Scroll: The Aetherial Scribe(save-to-git.ps1)This lesser scroll is a loyal scribe, tasked with preserving the masterwork in the Aetherial Archive (your GitHub repository).
The scribe is summoned only when wisdom deems it necessary: upon significant alteration to the master scroll, or upon the passing of a day, ensuring no great work is ever lost.

The Rites of Invocation

A note to fellow enchanters:
These scrolls were scribed for the author's personal sanctum. The inscribed paths reflect that domain and may require alteration to function within your own.
To command these powerful tools, you must observe the proper rites:

Place your alterations (mods) in D:\modding\Morrowind\custom.
Ensure the lesser golem (momw-configurator.exe) resides in D:\modding\Morrowind\momw-tools-pack.
Utter the incantation (openmw-config-automator.ps1) from a PowerShell.
Answer the Automaton's queries when your wisdom is sought.

Go forth, Enchanter. Your world awaits its master.
